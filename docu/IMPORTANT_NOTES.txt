Some values of the data structure of the datasheet at page 3 ARE WRONG:

- ph value is properly stored at bytes 4:7
- THE VALUES OF \x15 and \x16 ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE FOR HEAD AND TAIL!!!
    - ALSO DATA CAN CONTAIN THOSE VALUES!!!
        - SCREWING UP ANY METHOD TRYING TO GET A DATA PACKET WITHOUT KNOWING THE SIZE IN ADVANCE; AND IF WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF A PACKET!!!
        - HORRIBLE DESIGN.
